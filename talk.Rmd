* We write code in an RMarkdown file.
* knitr executes the code, stores the results, and prepares a markdown file.
* RMarkdown sends that file into pandoc along with any 
  templates or style files and pandoc gives a styled document.

# A range of output options

* A paragraph with some numbers plugged in.
* A styled document with figures, tables, and citations.
