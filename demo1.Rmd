```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```


Load some data: 

```{r load, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
df <- read_csv("./got_avgs.csv") %>% 
  select(Series, Season, EpNum = SubEp, 
         OverallEp = TotalEp,
         Episode, Rating = UserRating, 
         Votes = UserVotes)
```


Print the first 10 rows of the data as a table:

```{r table}
knitr::kable(head(df, 10))
```


The data in a plot:

```{r plot}
title <- paste0(df$Series[1], " episode ratings")

ggplot(df) +
  aes(x = OverallEp, y = Rating, color = factor(Season)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ 1, se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Overall Episode Number",
       y = "IMDB Rating", 
       color = "Season",
       caption = "Lines: Season averages") +
  ggtitle(title) + 
  expand_limits(y = 7:10) + 
  theme_grey(base_size = 16)
```
